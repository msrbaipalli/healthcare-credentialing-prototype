# 🏥 AI-Driven Real-Time Healthcare Provider Verification & Credentialing

A functional prototype demonstrating how Artificial Intelligence, real-time validation logic, and blockchain-inspired audit logging can modernize healthcare provider credentialing workflows in the United States.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a working prototype of an AI-powered healthcare provider verification and credentialing system.

Traditional credentialing systems rely on periodic manual reviews, document-heavy workflows, and fragmented databases. This project models a transition toward **continuous, automated, real-time provider verification** using intelligent validation logic and tamper-resistant audit tracking.

This implementation serves as a technical proof-of-concept for a broader innovation focused on improving:

- Provider data accuracy  
- Regulatory compliance  
- Patient safety  
- Administrative efficiency  

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Healthcare provider credentialing in the United States is currently:

- Manual and labor-intensive  
- Fragmented across systems and payers  
- Slow and delay-prone  
- Lacking transparent lifecycle tracking  
- Dependent on periodic re-verification cycles  

These inefficiencies can impact:

- Patient access to care  
- Network adequacy compliance  
- Claims accuracy  
- Operational costs  
- Risk exposure  

A modernized, real-time approach is required to address these systemic challenges.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This prototype introduces a modern verification architecture that includes:

- AI-driven rule-based credential validation (simulated)
- Continuous provider status evaluation
- Risk scoring logic
- Deep-linkable provider lifecycle tracking
- Blockchain-style append-only audit logs (simulated)
- Modern Angular-based operational dashboard

The system demonstrates how credentialing can shift from batch processing to intelligent, continuous monitoring.
